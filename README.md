Read on for my philosophy about maintaining a CV, and then look back at mine and find all the ways it's
STILL terrible despite my best attempts.


# My CV philosophy

This is one of those things I'm writing because I care about it, not because anyone else does. If you're
bored or curious (or one of three people in the world who care), by all means read on. And if you're
*really* engaged, let's [have a conversation](https://github.com/paulhibbing/CV/issues/1). I am NOT a designer,
for those who are, consider this your chance to school an amateur.

Anyway, my core beliefs about CVs are as follows:

- **Your CV is for both you and your reader.** Once you're through the early stages of your career,
  readers will primarily care about what you've accomplished, not what you're working on. So what?
  You still need to keep track of what you're working on, and the CV is a great place for that. So include everything.
  You may run into a situation where you're asked to shorten your CV for a specific application or submission. Go ahead.
  It's not that much work to temporarily remove things for specific purposes. Just keep a fully detailed version for
  yourself. It can really help.

- **You should open and update your CV frequently.** Don't wait until you need to share your CV to update it. Make a
  habit of updating your CV anytime you have a development of any sort. It should be a frequent occurrence (say, weekly)
  for you to open your CV for one reason or another. Add a "note to self" comment about the submission of a manuscript.
  Check a previous note about when your revisions are due on another manuscript. Update a citation that has moved from
  ahead-of-print to in-print. You get the picture

- **Structure is more important than page count.** If a person complains that a CV is too long, it likely reflects
  poor design/organization more than poor curating. This leads to the most important thing:

- **Above all, remember C.R.A.P.** I learned this from [The Non-Designer's Design and Type Books](https://www.abebooks.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Typographic-Principles-Visual/31257468081/bd?cm_mmc=ggl-_-US_Shopp_Textbook-_-product_id=COM9780321534057NEW-_-keyword=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwyt-ZBhCNARIsAKH1175uSpjU4mJIbAjje2Ayeg2_BqIgQFhi_JJE4pl_igYcwENzLmHRnI0aAkb4EALw_wcB)
  by Robin Williams (not that Robin Williams...) For obvious reasons, the acronym was unforgettable. It stands for
  Contrast, Repitition, Alignment, and Proximity. These are the elements that will help you combine written and
  visual communication. The idea of **contrast** is that your heading levels should be distinguishable from one
  another -- Vary the font family, size, face, color, indentation, etc. Avoid being subtle with your variations,
  because the whole point is for your reader to recognize that something has changed, and to understand the
  significance of the change. (The significance matters -- Don't make a subheading bigger than the main heading
  and call it "contrast.") The idea of **repetition** is that your layout should follow consistent rules. Really,
  this should be called *consistency*, but it ruins the acronym. Don't make formatting changes willy-nilly. Make
  changes when you can define a rule and reason for doing so, and make sure to apply the rule consistently throughout
  your document. The idea of **alignment** is mostly about indentation. As I recall, the key points are: 1) Don't use
  center alignment; 2) Don't be afraid of left alignment; and 3) Whatever you do, don't mix different alignments if
  at all possible. Lastly, the idea of **proximity** is related to how you use space. Elements that are close together
  should have a close relationship to each other. Elements that are far apart should be distinct from each other. The
  big point is, avoid symmetrical spacing. Don't put 12pt before your heading and 12pt after. Take a look at what happens
  when you put 18pt before and 6pt after. In general, this area gives me the most satisfaction in documents (like a CV)
  that follow a strict outline. I find it looks nice to have progressively tighter spacing as you move down your heading levels.

- **A couple of opinions for the road.**  *1)* As you think about the above, never forget about white space. It's lovely to look
  at, and should guide your considerations about CRAP.  *2)* Enable navigation when you share a PDF of your CV. This means learning
  how to use headings in your text editor, and how to ensure those headings are turned into bookmarks when converting to PDF. I haven't
  decided yet if a table of contents is out of the question, but I *have* seen it before and hope to add one myself someday. For now,
  I'm not brave enough. *2)* Be mindful of readability and legibility. Right or wrong, from my limited research, I've convinced
  myself that serif fonts and ragged edges (no justification) are easiest to read. In my experience, justification isn't worth it
  anyway, because there is inevitably a place or two where spacing/kerning get thrown way off, and it ruins everything.
