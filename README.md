Below, you can read about my (probably ill-formed, but opinionated nonetheless) philosophy regarding the design and maintenance of a CV.
Then, best of all, compare what I've said against what I've actually done in my CV, marveling at all the ways it's STILL
terrible and doesn't even follow my own questionable advice. Lastly, [join the conversation](https://github.com/paulhibbing/CV/issues/1)
and tell me your thoughts. (I guess I should put "conversation" in quotes, because this will probably interest precisely no one.
But maybe I'll be surprised. Regardless, this is one of those things I'm writing because I care about it, not because anyone else does.
So deal with it.)

Anyway, enough blather. Here goes:


# My CV philosophy

- **Your CV is for both you and your reader.** Once you're through the early stages of your career,
  readers will primarily care about what you've accomplished, not what you're working on. So what?
  You still need to keep track of what you're working on, and the CV is a great place for that. So include everything.
  You may run into a situation where you're asked to share your CV in a shortened form, or in a context where you'd
  rather not list work in progress. Fine. Just take out the extra stuff temporarily. It's not that much work to cut things
  out in these situations. On the other hand, it's a lot of work to round everything up if you suddenly decide you want to see
  it for yourself. Let your CV be a resource that benefits you and your efforts to coordinate everything you're working on.
  Then let it double as something you share with others whenever the need arises, and in whatever form befits the occasion.

- **You should open and update your CV frequently.** Don't wait until you need to share your CV to update it. Make a
  habit of updating your CV anytime you have a development of any sort. It should be a frequent occurrence (say, weekly)
  for you to open your CV for one reason or another. Add a "note to self" comment about the submission of a manuscript.
  Check a previous note about when your revisions are due on another manuscript, or about how long it has been under
  review in case you need to follow up with the journal. Update a citation that has moved from ahead-of-print to in-print.
  You get the picture. (I should clarify, I'm not suggesting that you post a new CV on your website or GitHub every week.
  Just that your private copy should be up to date and easy to polish at a moment's notice when you *do* need to share it or post it.)
  And speaking of citations: Make a point of updating them, especially if your paper was accepted ahead of print and not published
  in print until the following year. Yes, the work stopped for you in year `X`. But most people will recognize the work as
  being published in the year `X + 1` with volume, issue, and page numbers. Your citations should reflect these details.

- **Structure is more important than page count.** If a person complains that a CV is too long, it likely reflects
  poor design/organization rather than inclusion of too much content. This leads to the most important thing:

- **Above all, remember C.R.A.P.** I learned this from [The Non-Designer's Design and Type Books](https://www.abebooks.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Typographic-Principles-Visual/31257468081/bd?cm_mmc=ggl-_-US_Shopp_Textbook-_-product_id=COM9780321534057NEW-_-keyword=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwyt-ZBhCNARIsAKH1175uSpjU4mJIbAjje2Ayeg2_BqIgQFhi_JJE4pl_igYcwENzLmHRnI0aAkb4EALw_wcB)
  by Robin Williams (not *that* Robin Williams...) For obvious reasons, the acronym was unforgettable. It stands for
  Contrast, Repitition, Alignment, and Proximity. These are the elements that will help you combine written and
  visual communication in your CV. The idea of **contrast** is that your heading levels should be distinguishable
  from one another -- Vary the font family, size, face, color, indentation, etc. Avoid being subtle with your variations,
  because the whole point is for your reader to recognize that something has changed, and to understand the
  significance of the change. (The significance piece is important and needs to make sense. Don't make a subheading
  bigger than the main heading and call it "contrast.") The idea of **repetition** is that your layout should follow
  consistent rules. Really, this should be called *consistency*, but it ruins the acronym. Don't make formatting changes
  willy-nilly. Instead, make changes only when you can define a rule that will help you apply the change consistently throughout
  your document. The idea of **alignment** is mostly about indentation, at least for documents. (Graphic design pieces are different...)
  As I recall, the key points are: 1) Don't use center alignment; 2) Don't be afraid of left alignment; and 3) Whatever you do,
  don't mix alignments. Lastly, the idea of **proximity** is related to how you use space. Elements that are close together should
  have a close relationship to each other. Elements that are far apart should be distinct from each other. The big point is,
  avoid symmetrical spacing. Don't put 12pt before your heading and 12pt after. Take a look at what happens when you instead put 18pt
  before and 6pt after. In general, this area gives me the most satisfaction in documents (like a CV) that follow a strict
  outline. I find it looks nice to have progressively tighter spacing as you move down your heading levels.

- **A couple of opinions for the road.**  *1)* As you think about the above, never forget about white space. It's lovely to look
  at, and should guide your considerations about CRAP. This is why I really don't think length is a big issue for the CV. If it's
  pleasant to look at and has an intelligible structure, people will put up with a long document. *2)* Speaking of structure,
  enable navigation when you share a PDF of your CV. This means learning how to use headings in your text editor, and how to
  ensure those headings are turned into bookmarks when converting to PDF. I haven't decided yet if a table of contents is out of
  the question, but I *have* seen it before and hope to add one myself someday. For now, I'm not brave enough. *3)* Be mindful of
  readability and legibility. Right or wrong, from my limited research, I've convinced myself that serif fonts and ragged edges
  (no justification) are easiest to read. In my experience, justification isn't worth it anyway, because there is inevitably a
  place or two where spacing/kerning get thrown way off, and it ruins everything.
  
That's it. Those are my main thoughts. I'd love to hear yours.
